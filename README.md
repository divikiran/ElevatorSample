# ElevatorSample
4 elevators on 10 floor building 

This code is made to just to test my Xamarin skills, work is in progress...
Need to install Xamarin for this code to run.
On clicking on floor people are on, it will give you option to select floors.
Depending on the user selection, nearest elevator will respond to the floor and take people to that floor.
